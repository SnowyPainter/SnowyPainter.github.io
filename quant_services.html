            <h2>What are Quantitative Strategies?</h2>
            <p>Quantitative strategies leverage mathematical models and statistical methods to make trading decisions. These strategies are based on historical data, algorithms, and various financial metrics to generate signals for trading.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data-driven:</strong> Decisions are based on data analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic:</strong> Strategies are often automated using algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Removes emotional biases from trading.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>Neo Strategy <button class="cta-button"><a href="https://github.com/SnowyPainter/fromisnine/releases/tag/PairTrader">Try it</a></button></h3>
                    <p>It contains 3 models. Trend predictor, News reader, Price forecaster.</p>
                    <p>Most decisions are basically controlled by models.</p>   
                    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High prediction accuracy, achieving at least 58% success rate, and up to nearly 90% in optimal conditions.</li>
                        <li>Improved returns, with maximum gains(in simulation) ranging from 19% to 25% and minimum losses improving from -9% to 0%.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced Sharpe ratio, indicating better risk-adjusted returns.</li>
                        <li>Stronger performance compared to MA breakthrough strategy.</li>
                        <li>Overall better performance, with prediction accuracy over 55%, making it superior to not using it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limited usefulness of price predictions alone; more effective when combined with trend forecasting.</li>
                        <li>May not perform well for certain stock pairs, leading to suboptimal results.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Compound Strategy <button class="cta-button"><a href="https://github.com/SnowyPainter/fromisnine/releases/tag/PairTrader">Try it</a></button></h3>
                    <p>It works with only two mathematical models.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The CIR model provides a simulation of the initial asset price, which is crucial for generating trading signals based on the z-score between two assets.</li>
                        <li>This strategy is particularly effective in capturing optimal trading moments in volatile financial markets.</li>
                        <li>Pair trading allows for profit by adjusting the holding ratio between two stocks, potentially benefiting even when only one asset's value increases.</li>
                        <li>The CIR model's price simulation, combined with z-score calculations, can gather signals for all possible future scenarios, enhancing the speed of adjusting asset weights in pair trading.</li>
                        <li>Reduces the latency commonly associated with machine learning models and decreases trading costs by minimizing unnecessary signal adjustments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Relies on accurate asset price simulations, which may not always reflect real market conditions.</li>
                        <li>Despite adjustments, achieving consistent accuracy above 90% for each asset using deep learning or time series models remains challenging.</li>
                    </ul>
